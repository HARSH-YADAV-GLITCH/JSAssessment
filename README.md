This is a Metacrafters Final Project after completion of Javascript course. 

Explaination of the above code:

1. The Project is about managing NFTs using JavaScript.
2. It starts by creating an empty array `VarNFTs` to store the NFTs.
3. The `mintNFT` function accepts three inputs/parameters: `_name`, `_place`, and `_hairColour`, and creates an NFT object with these details.
4. This object is then added to the `VarNFTs` array, and a message is printed to the console indicating the NFT was created.
5. The `listNFTs` function goes through each NFT in the `VarNFTs` array and prints its details, including an ID number, to the console.
6. There is also a mention of a `getTotalSupply` function that would return the number of NFTs created, which is the length of the `VarNFTs` array.
